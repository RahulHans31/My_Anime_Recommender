# Anime Recommendation System

## Overview
This repository contains an Anime Recommendation System designed to provide personalized anime recommendations based on user preferences. Whether you're an anime enthusiast or a newcomer, this system aims to enhance your viewing experience by suggesting anime titles that align with your tastes.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques (e.g., user-based or item-based) to recommend anime based on similar users' preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Considers anime attributes (e.g., genre, studio, release year) to recommend titles with similar characteristics.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines collaborative and content-based methods for robust recommendations.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to rate anime, update preferences, and receive real-time recommendations.

## Getting Started
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather anime data from sources such as MyAnimeList, AniList, or Kaggle datasets.
   - Extract relevant information (e.g., titles, genres, ratings).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
   - Create user-anime interaction matrices.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Implement collaborative filtering algorithms (e.g., matrix factorization, nearest neighbors).
   - Develop content-based models using anime attributes.
   - Combine models to create hybrid recommendations.

4. **User Interface**:
   - Design a user-friendly interface for users to input preferences and receive recommendations.
   - Allow users to rate anime and update their profiles.

## Usage
1. **User Registration**:
   - Users create profiles by providing their anime preferences (favorite genres, watched titles).

2. **Recommendations**:
   - Based on user profiles, recommend anime titles.
   - Display top recommendations with confidence scores.

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Users rate recommended anime.
   - Update user profiles with new interactions.

## Evaluation
1. **Metrics**:
   - Evaluate recommendation quality using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Conduct A/B testing to compare different recommendation approaches.

2. **User Satisfaction**:
   - Collect user feedback to assess system performance.
   - Continuously improve recommendations based on user input.
